# Master List
With every major WordPress release, the support team creates a Master List to help users troubleshoot, and inform of common issues.

Why a GitHub repository?
---
With every release, the common issues that pop up are generally different. Currently we just create a new post, and let the old one disappear 
into nothingness on the forums, where a new one steps up to take its place.

Although the old lists are still availabl, they're hard to find, and generally unorganized. By providing a version controlled history
of the content of these, we make it easier to look notice trends, and also to find back to issues with specific releases (especially
useful for sites updating from older versions).

With each new major release, starting with WordPress 5.3, a new tag is created to make it easier to jump back in time.
