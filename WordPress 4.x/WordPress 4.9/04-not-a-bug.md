# Not a bug

- If you add or remove new page templates or other files to a theme without changing the version number, it may take up to an hour for the changes to take effect. This is due to caching, and is being discussed in [#42573](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42573) – Reverted in 4.9.1
- I don’t see the new comment form checkbox. This may be due to your plugin or theme changing the comment form from the default provided by WordPress. It’s also worth noting that the box is only available to anonymous, non-logged in users.
