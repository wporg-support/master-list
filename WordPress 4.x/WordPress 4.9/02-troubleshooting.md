Before posting, please make sure you’ve tried started by performing the troubleshooting steps outlined below:

- **Flushing any caching plugins you might be running**, as well as server and/or **[browser caches](http://www.refreshyourcache.com/)**. Not just your browser, but any op cache or content network cache as well [such as Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169246-How-do-I-purge-my-cache-). That will solve many weird JavaScript issues.
- **Flushing Managed host caches**. Managed WP hosting often has special caches. If your host has a “Purge Varnish” or “Flush Memcache” tool, try that. You can ask your provider to flush memcache and Varnish for you if necessary.
- **Troubleshooting with your browser**. Your browser can help you identify JavaScript issues or conflicts and [this article can assist you in doing that diagnosis](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors). This could help identify Visual Editor issues as well.
- Deactivating all plugins (yes, all) to see if this resolves the problem. If this works, re-activate the plugins one by one until you find the problematic plugin(s). If you can’t get into your admin dashboard, try resetting the plugins folder by [SFTP/FTP](https://codex.wordpress.org/FTP_Clients) or PhpMyAdmin (read [“How to deactivate all plugins when you can’t log in to wp-admin”](https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Troubleshooting#How_to_deactivate_all_plugins_when_not_able_to_access_the_administrative_menus.3F) if you need help). Sometimes, an apparently inactive plugin can still cause problems. Also remember to deactivate any plugins in the mu-plugins folder. The easiest way is to rename that folder to `mu-plugins-old`
- Switching to the Twenty Sixteen theme to rule out any theme-specific problems. If you can’t log in to change themes, you can remove the theme folders via [SFTP/FTP](https://codex.wordpress.org/FTP_Clients) so the only one is `twentysixteen`. That will force your site to use it.
- Manually upgrading. When all else fails, download a fresh copy of the latest.zip file of 4.9 (top right on this page) to your computer, and use that to copy up. You may need to delete the wp-admin and wp-includes folders on your server (**NOTE: do not delete the `wp-content` directory or your `wp-config.php` file**) Read the [Manual Update directions first](https://codex.wordpress.org/Updating_WordPress#Manual_Update).
