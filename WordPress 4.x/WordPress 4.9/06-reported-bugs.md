# Reported bugs

- JavaScript heavy pages, such as the Customizer or post editors, break when using languages with formal/informal variations. This is being tracked and has a workaround in [#42574](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42574) – Fixed in 4.9.1.
- Theme and plugin editors are unable to save files when hosted on Windows servers. See [#42609](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42609) – Fixed in 4.9.1.
- Images with captions in my post are bigger than they should and the background fills up larger parts of the content area. See [#42604](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42604).
