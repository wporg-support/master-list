# CORE CHANGES

What’s New:

- [Database upgrades for emoji support and unicode](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/04/02/the-utf8mb4-upgrade/). The emoji support works with browsers that do not have native support. This support can be disabled via the [Disable Emojis](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-emojis/) plugin. If you want to disable the new emoji code and also revert all the smilies back to their original versions, use the [Classic Smilies](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-smilies/) plugin instead.
- [Term splitting in 4.2](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/04/02/reminder-term-splitting-in-4-2/). This should be transparent to users but some plugins may be effected and need to be fixed.

What’s Changed:

- [Press This](https://codex.wordpress.org/Press_This) has been completely revamped to make sharing content from around the web easier than ever.
- [Default Admin Color Scheme got cleaned up.](https://make.wordpress.org/design/2015/04/05/default-admin-color-scheme-update/) The colors have been softened up. It’s not a massive change like MP6, just a slight visual one. You may not even notice.
