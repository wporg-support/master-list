# Known Issues

- Some users have reported altered Media titles after upgrading to WordPress 4.6.1. See [#37989](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37989) for details. (fixed in 4.7)
- When enabled, plugin auto-updates can fail if they involve several plugins in a row. See [#38024](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38024) for details. (fixed in 4.7)
- Some users have reported “cURL error 23: Failed writing body” when updating plugins or themes. See [#38226](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38226) for details. (fixed in 4.7)
- Some users have reported an increase in function calls to get_locale() since the update. See [#37997](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37997) for details. (fixed in 4.7)
- A very small number of users have reported seeing ** Warning: ini_get_all() has been disabled for security reasons** after the update. Please contact your hosting provider and ask them to enable `ini_get_all()` (which is perfectly safe on a properly maintained server). Alternatively, you may be able to fix this issue yourself by upgrading your version of PHP to 5.6 or higher (if available in your hosting account’s control panel). The WordPress developers are considering an adjustment to WordPress as well to avoid this, see [#37680](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37680) for details. (fixed in 4.6.1)
- A very small number of users have reported seeing **Warning: curl_exec() has been disabled for security reasons** after the update. Please contact your hosting provider and ask them to enable `curl_exec()` (which is perfectly safe on a properly maintained server). Alternatively, you may be able to fix this issue yourself by upgrading your version of PHP to 5.6 or higher (if available in your hosting account’s control panel). The WordPress developers are considering an adjustment to WordPress as well to avoid this, see [#37700](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37700) and [below](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/read-this-first-wordpress-46-master-list?replies=4&view=all#post-8770164) for details. (fixed in 4.6.1)
- A very small number of users have reported seeing Notice: Undefined variable: collate after the update. [Setting DB_COLLATE in wp-config.php](https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Database_collation) will fix this for now. See [#37683](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37683) for details. (fixed in 4.6.1)
- A very small number of users have reported seeing ** symbols converted into invalid characters** after the update. Commenting out the [DB_CHARSET define in wp-config.php](https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Database_character_set) (adding a `#` in front of the line) will fix this for now. See [#37689](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37689) for details. (fixed in 4.6.1)
- A small number of users have reported **emails not being sent out as expected**. This is due to a new flag being added to show who sent the email which doesn’t function properly on all hosts. See [#37736](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37736) for details. (fixed in 4.6.1)
