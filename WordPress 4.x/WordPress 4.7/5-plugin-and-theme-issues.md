# Plugin and theme issues

- _W3 Total cache_ – Version 0.9.5.1 is incompatible with WordPress 4.7, so please upgrade to version 0.9.5.2 or higher.
- _Genesis theme sidebar issues_ – If you have a problem with sidebars in the Genesis theme then please upgrade to the latest version of that commercial theme.
- _Twenty Seventeen Icons are Huge_ – Older versions of [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) will conflict with icon styles in the Twenty Seventeen theme, making Twenty Seventeen’s icons larger than expected. Please make sure that you’re using either the latest version of Font Awesome or the latest version of any plugin that’s bundling it.
