# Core Changes

**[Fullscreen editing by default](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/03/03/fullscreen-mode-enabled-by-default-in-the-editor/)**

The block editor will by default display in fullscreen mode after WordPress 5.4.

For instructions on how to leave fullscreen mode, please see our [article about the block editor](https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/#how-to-switch-off-fullscreen-mode).

*Note:* Some browsers, most notably  Safari, does not properly remember your settings at the time of release for WordPress 5.4.0,
you can use the [lockeditor Fullscreen Mode Control plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blockeditor-fullscreen-mode-control/) to 
persistently save this option and change the default display at this time.

**[Changes to the calendar widget](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/02/12/changes-related-to-calendar-widget-markup-in-wordpress-5-4/)**

The calendar widget had some changes made to its HTML code, this may mean taht your theme might not display it as you would normally expect,
if you are using the widget, and it looks a bit out of place, please reach out to your theme author for an update.
