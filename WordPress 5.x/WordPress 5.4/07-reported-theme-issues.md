This section contains noteworthy (high impact/large) themes with compatibility issues, and their responses when available.

- Preview of blocks in the Block Editor has errors with current version of Hestia theme. See: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/problems-with-blocks-in-hestia-after-wordpress-updating-to-wordpress-4-5_nl/ <br>An update of the theme has been released that hopefully solves the issue, see comments under he linked post.
- Some non-free themes from paid sources cause minor incompatibility issues with the latest version of the block editor. These can manifest as “This block has encountered an error and cannot be previewed”. Go to where you purchased your theme, and download an update for it. The marketplace where you bought the theme may have an update plugin you should use to keep the theme up to date.
