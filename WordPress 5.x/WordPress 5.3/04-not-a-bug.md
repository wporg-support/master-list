# Not a bug

Noteworthy and recurring scenarios users are encountering that are not actually bugs, but rather changed or new behaviors.

**Elements in the admin area have borders now!?**

WordPress 5.3 ships with improved contrasts for the admin area. This is part of the projects ever ongoing work to improve accessibility.

**Some of the blocks in my editor look strange**

Some changes wee made to the HTML used to display blocks. Although this won't affect any existing content, editing or writing new content where a theme or plugin is expecting certain styles may look strange. We recommend updating your themes and plugins, or reaching out to the authors if there's no updates available to address this change yet.
