# Core Changes

**New default theme: Twenty Twenty**

WordPress 5.3 comes with a new default theme, Twenty Twenty. This simple, yet stylish, theme provides multiple menu configurations, a page template that uses the featured image as large background image, color options that maintain accessible color contrast, and styles that work in the block editor and in the classic editor.

**New Site Admin Email Verification Screen**

When you next login, you may be presented wit ha screen prompting you to ensure the Site Admin Email is correct. This is the address used by WordPress to contact a site owner if cases such as failed updates, fatal errors, and more.

This screen will, by default, show up once every 6 months, much like other popular services prompt you to keep your contact details current. The frequency can be changed, or the feature disabled, through code or plugins.
