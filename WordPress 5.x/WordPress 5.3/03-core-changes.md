# Core Changes

**New default theme: Twenty Twenty**

WordPress 5.3 comes with a shiny new default theme, Twenty Twenty. This simple, yet stylish, theme puts the block editor introduced with WordPress 5.0 front and centre, giving the user much of the creative freedom that the editor provides.

**New Site Admin Email Verification Screen**

When you next login, you may be presented wit ha screen prompting you to ensure the Site Admin Email is correct. This is the address used by WordPress to contact a site owner if cases such as failed updates, fatal errors, and more.

This screen will, by default, show up once every 6 months, much like other popular services prompt you to keep your contact details current. The frequency can be changed, or the feature disabled, through code or plugins.
