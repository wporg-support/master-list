Before posting, please make sure you’ve tried started by performing the troubleshooting steps outlined below:

- **Flushing any caching plugins you might be running**, as well as server and/or [browser caches](http://www.refreshyourcache.com/). Not just your browser, but any op cache or content network cache as well [such as Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169246-How-do-I-purge-my-cache-). That will solve many weird JavaScript issues.
- **Flushing Managed host caches**. Managed WP hosting often has special caches. If your host has a “Purge Varnish” or “Flush Memcache” tool, try that. You can ask your provider to flush memcache and Varnish for you if necessary.
- **Resave your Permalink settings**. In a few cases, we’ve seen third-party installers, such as Softaculous, creating sites with slightly incorrect rules in the .htaccess file. While these rules would not have been a problem in previous versions, in WordPress 5.0, having these incorrect rules can break the REST API. Resaving the permalinks on the Settings->Permalinks page in WordPress will fix these rules in the .htaccess file, and possibly fix “failed” errors in the new editor.
- **Troubleshooting with your browser**. Your browser can help you identify JavaScript issues or conflicts and [this article can assist you in doing that diagnosis](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-your-browser-to-diagnose-javascript-errors/). This could help identify Visual Editor issues as well.
- **Make sure you have the Visual Editor enabled**. Visit your Users->Your Profile page. The first option will disable the visual editor. Make sure that option is unchecked, and save your profile settings.
- Deactivating **all plugins** (yes, all) to see if this resolves the problem. If this works, re-activate the plugins one by one until you find the problematic plugin(s). If you can’t get into your admin dashboard, try resetting the plugins folder by [SFTP/FTP](https://wordpress.org/support/article/ftp-clients/) or PhpMyAdmin (read [“How to deactivate all plugins when you can’t log in to wp-admin”](https://wordpress.org/support/article/faq-troubleshooting/) if you need help). Sometimes, an apparently inactive plugin can still cause problems. Also remember to deactivate any plugins in the mu-plugins folder. The easiest way is to rename that folder to `mu-plugins-old`
- Switching to the Twenty Nineteen theme to rule out any theme-specific problems. If you can’t log in to change themes, you can remove the theme folders via [SFTP/FTP](https://wordpress.org/support/article/ftp-clients/) so the only one is `twentynineteen`. That will force your site to use it.
- Manually upgrading. When all else fails, download a fresh copy of the latest.zip file of 5.0.* (top right on this page) to your computer, and use that to copy up. You may need to delete the wp-admin and wp-includes folders on your server (**NOTE: do not delete the `wp-content` directory or your `wp-config.php` file**) Read the [Manual Update directions first](https://wordpress.org/support/article/updating-wordpress/).
- If you can install plugins, install “Health Check”: https://wordpress.org/plugins/health-check/On the troubleshooting tab, you can click the button to disable all plugins and change the theme for you, while you’re still logged in, **without affecting normal visitors to your site**.

If you need to create a support topic, the [Health Check plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/health-check/) is also able to provide debug data for the support volunteers.
