# Core Changes

**Application Passwords**

WordPress now comes with a built in way for applications to interact with your website, allowing more apps and services
to integrate more easily with your site and its content.

**Auto-updates for WordPress**

In WordPress 5.5, auto-updates for your plugins and themes were made more prominent, and offered the site administrator 
a way to turn these on or off. In WordPress 5.6, you now get the same option for WordPress it self as well.

**jQuery has been updated**

WordPress has bundled the jQuery library for years, and with this release comes a major update to the library it self as well.

If you should experience issues after the update, relating to elements like sliders, buttons or similar, it may be related
to a plugin or theme being incompatible with the new version of jQuery, for cases like this the [Enable jQuery Migrate Helper plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-jquery-migrate-helper) may help you out.

**A new default theme: Twenty Twenty-One**

As has become almost a tradition at the end of the year release, WordPress 5.6 introduces a new default theme.

This is a simple theme, focusing heavily on letting the site owner create the pages adn ocntent they need through the power
of the block editor.

**PHP 8**

The next major version release of PHP, 8.0.0, is scheduled a few days prior to WordPress 5.6. The WordPress project has 
a long history of being compatible with new versions of PHP as soon as possible, and this release is no different.

Because PHP 8 is a major version release, changes that break backward compatibility or compatibility for various APIs are allowed.
While all of the detectable issues in WordPress can be fixed, you will need to verify that all of your plugins and themes 
are also compatible with PHP 8 prior to upgrading your PHP version.
