# Core Changes

**Application Passwords**

WordPress now comes with a built in way for applications to interact with your website, allowing more apps and services
to integrate more easily with your site and its content.

**Auto-updates for WordPress**

In WordPress 5.5, auto-updates for your plugins and themes were made more prominent, and offered the site administrator 
a way to turn these on or off. In WordPress 5.6, you now get the same option for WordPress it self as well.

**jQuery has been updated**

WordPress has bundled the jQuery library for years, and with this release comes a major update to the library it self as well.

If you should experience issues after the update, relating to elements like sliders, buttons or similar, it may be related
to a plugin or theme being incompatible with the new version of jQuery, for cases like this the [Enable jQuery Migrate Helper plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-jquery-migrate-helper) may help you out.

**A new default theme: Twenty Twenty-One**

As has become almost a tradition at the end of the year release, WordPress 5.6 introduces a new default theme.

This is a simple theme, focusing heavily on letting the site owner create the pages adn ocntent they need through the power
of the block editor.
