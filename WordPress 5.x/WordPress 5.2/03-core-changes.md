# Core Changes

**Site Health Check**

Building on the Site Health features introduced in 5.1, this release adds two new pages to help debug common configuration issues. It also adds space where developers can include debugging information for site maintainers. Check your site status, and learn how to debug issues.

**PHP Error Protection**

This administrator-focused update will let you safely fix or manage fatal errors without requiring developer time. It features better handling of the so-called “white screen of death,” and a way to enter recovery mode, which pauses error-causing plugins or themes.

**Accessibility Updates**

A number of changes work together to improve contextual awareness and keyboard navigation flow for those using screen readers and other assistive technologies.

**New Dashboard Icons**

Thirteen new icons include Instagram, a suite of icons for BuddyPress, and rotated Earth icons for global inclusion. Find them in the Dashboard and have some fun!
