# CHANGES THAT MAY IMPACT YOU

- Masonry Script Updates â€“ Some themes may be [affected by the updated script](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/03/27/masonry-in-wordpress-3-9/).
- â€˜wpdialogsâ€™ is no longer used by TinyMCE in core â€“ Plugins that rely on it, but do not enqueue it, will need to. There is a warning that will appear in the JavaScript console (which you can debug using the instructions youâ€™ve provided above) if you attempt to use it, and itâ€™s not enqueued.
- If you preview other themes in the customizer, you may lose your widgets. See https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27897 for details.
