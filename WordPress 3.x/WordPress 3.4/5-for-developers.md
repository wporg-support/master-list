# FOR DEVELOPERS

So your theme/plugin is breaking?

For themes, we recommend perusing http://make.wordpress.org/themes for any WordPress 3.4-related Theme issues. The biggest one is the handling of custom backgrounds and custom headers. Thereâ€™s not a whole lot else.

By the way, if you get a lot of weird warnings and youâ€™re _not_ a developer, go into your wp-config.php file and make sure that youâ€™ve got `define('WP_DEBUG', false);` set ðŸ™‚ You donâ€™t need it if youâ€™re not debugging.
