#MISSING FLASH/EMBED BUTTONS

From Nacin:

> Sorry all,
> 
> The plugin was removed due to licensing issues. It should never have been included in WordPress, and was never used by many. It wonâ€™t be coming back to WordPress core.
> 
> You should look at the oEmbeds feature: http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds
> 
> I imagine there are other plugins out there that may be able to leverage this, but the plugin would not be compatible with the WordPress license.
