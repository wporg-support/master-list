# jQUERY SLIDERS BREAKING

WP Pretty Photo and other jQuery sliders are breaking because of the new version of jQuery that comes with 3.1.

See http://www.kriesi.at/support/topic/wp-31-breaks-lightbox for WP Pretty Photo update.

Two other plugins that stopped the media lightbox uploader.
* NextGEN Gallery Version 1.7.4 | By Alex Rabe (latest)
* Social Discussions Version 5.1.0 | By LinksAlpha (latest)

Some category excluder plugins such as Ultimate Category Excluder may be broken as well. That one is actually a bug: [Trac Ticket](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16622)
The Hotfix plugin now has a fix that might help: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hotfix/
