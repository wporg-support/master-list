# MULTISITE CAVEATS

Any plugin using the Super Admin menu got their menu items reshuffled. If you can’t find the Super Grover– ADMIN toolbar, look on your top RIGHT of your Admin

If you’re behind a NAT proxy or a firewall and things are REALLY slow, try turning OFF your admin bar.

From spherical:

- Only the theme on the blog you are using to perform the upgrade (Primary Blog on Multisite) needs to be changed during the upgrade
- Did rename the /plugins directory after deactivating plugins on only the Primary Blog; just to be sure nothing bad would happen in the background and to take advantage of the “Recently Active” list when I was finished
- Did not rename /mu-plugins

Full procedure used is listed [here](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/upgrade-to-31-a-positive-note-and-the-process).
