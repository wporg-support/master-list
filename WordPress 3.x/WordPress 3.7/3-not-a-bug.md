# NOT A BUG

_I don’t want background updates you suck!_

The core team and many others sat and discussed this for a long time. The auto-updates are there to mitigate security issues, and they’re on by default because the people who need them the most are the same people who would be less likely to notice and turn it on. While you may disagree with this rationale, it’s not a bug. It was a conscious decision. Keep in mind, they’re turned off for people who legitimately SHOULD have them off, like folks who have to enter their FTP credentials when installing plugins etc.

Disabling auto-updates for maintenance and security releases is strongly discouraged. If you still want to disable them, [follow these instructions](http://codex.wordpress.org/Disabling_Automatic_Background_Updates).
