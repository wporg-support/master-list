# CORE CHANGES

Whatâ€™s new:

- **Background Updates**:  WordPress now auto-updates minor releases for security fixes. This means when 3.7.1 comes out, you will be automatically updated to that provided you meet certain criteria. If youâ€™re using SVN/GIT/Any-versioning-software or have to enter your FTP credentials to upgrade, the background updates are disabled. If theyâ€™re NOT working, install http://wordpress.org/plugins/background-update-tester/ and see why ðŸ™‚

Short list. I know. Thereâ€™s more, like a better search, date queries, and stuff like that. Most of this release was under the hood, though.
