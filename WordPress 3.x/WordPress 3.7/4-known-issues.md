_If you somehow ended up on WP 3.8-alpha…_ 

Just download a fresh copy of 3.7 and overlay the files to go back. The odds are you were either on the beta testers plugin without meaning to be, or you had used the Release Candidate and got upgraded to 3.8 before 3.7 was released (there was a small crossover of time that happened). If this is NOT the case, or the roll back to 3.7 files doesn’t fix you, then make a post.
