# CORE CHANGES

What’s new:

- **Twenty Thirteen**: We’re shipping this year’s default theme in our first release of the year. Twenty Thirteen is an opinionated, color-rich, blog-centric theme that makes full use of the new Post Formats support.
- **Audio/Video**: You can embed audio and video files into your posts without relying on a plugin or a third party media hosting service.
- **Autosave**:  Posts are now autosaved locally. If your browser crashes, your computer dies, or the server goes offline as you’re saving, you won’t lose the your post.
- **Post Locking**:  See when someone is currently editing a post, and kick them out of it if they fall asleep at the keyboard.
- **Menus**:  Menus have been changed to an accordion-based UI, and a separate tab for assigning menus to theme locations.
- **Revisions**: The all-new revisions UI features avatars, a slider that “scrubs” through history, and two-slider range comparisons.
- **Login Expiration Warning**: If your logged in session expires, WordPress will ask you to log back in without taking you away from the page (which is awesome if you’re editing a post).
