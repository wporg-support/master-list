# TWENTY ELEVEN ISSUES

If you don’t like Twenty Eleven, that’s okay, but that’s not a bug. Remember you don’t have to use it if you don’t want to. There are hundreds of FREE themes out there (including Twenty Ten!) in http://wordpress.org/extend/themes – Enjoy!

There are already plugins that work well with customizing Twenty Eleven past the defaults. Check out http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=twenty+eleven
