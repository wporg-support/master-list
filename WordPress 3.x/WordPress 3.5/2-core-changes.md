# CORE CHANGES

Outside of the normal changes (buttons are now square, colors have been tweaked, code has been optimized), there’s one major new feature that everyone will be talking about: Improved Media Uploader.

The media uploader is improved, and the way you insert galleries into your posts is changed. Just like before, you can upload and insert media (images, audio, document files, etc.) by clicking the Add Media button. The drag-and-drop box (introduced in WordPress 3.3) now overlays the whole screen. There’s no need to press ‘save’ to change your title, alt tags, or captions, as WordPress will save it for you on the fly. To create an image gallery, select the images to add and click on the “Create a new gallery” button. It’s just that easy.

Also included in 3.5 is the new default theme, Twenty Twelve – http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentytwelve – which is a responsive theme that looks good on mobile devices, without any extra work needed by you. Twenty Twelve is also the first WordPress default theme that was designed to work either as a traditional website or a blog.

One other major change is the Link Manager. If you’re using it, you’ll want to install the Link Manager plugin – http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/link-manager/ – because it’s going away. Don’t worry, if you’re using it, it will still be there, but if you’ve never used it, it will become invisible.

If you’re a fan of the HTML (i.e. plain text) editor, that’s been renamed to ‘Text’ to more accurately describe what it really is. There are also new oEmbeds (Slideshare, Instagram, and SoundCloud), and the oEmbed feature is now on for everyone.
